# Operating Systems Project

Our Operating Systems Class Project (2021/2022), done in collaboration with [Diogo Melita](https://github.com/D-Melita).

Our goal was, in a first moment, to make a given file system's set of basic operations be thread-safe (such as opening, closing, reading and writing files).

In the second part of our project, the goal was to make that same file system be able to serve multiple client processes in a concurrent, rather than sequencial manner.

We used C for this project.
